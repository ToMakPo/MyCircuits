2019.07.30 - Got the repository set up and added the files I've been working on. As of right now, the 
             project is still in the very early stages and is not ready to be used.
2019.07.31 - Made improvements to the zoom in and out options and the move viewport buttons. 
                ... Added a dropdown option to select which zoom percentage to use. 
                ... The move viewport buttons are now anchored onto the edges when window is resized.
